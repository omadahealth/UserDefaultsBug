# UserDefaults Bug
## Automated Test to demonstrate bug in iOS UserDefaults

## Step to reproduce:
 1. Open Project in Xcode 9.2
 1. Select iPhone X Simulator
 1. Run tests by pressing `Command-U` or Select `Product->Test` in the menu
 1. If test pass run again
 1. Notice test failed. To restart delete the app on Simulator
 
 ## Explanation
 
 This test simply saves and read two different values in UserDefaults. It should be repeatable and passing all the time.
